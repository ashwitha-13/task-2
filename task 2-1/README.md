Data Cleaning & Missing Value Handling
Overview:
This task focuses on cleaning the House Price dataset by identifying and handling missing values to improve data quality and prepare the dataset for analysis and machine learning.

Dataset: Day3_House_Price_data (1).csv
Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib

Steps Performed:
Identified missing values using isnull().sum().
Visualized missing data using a bar chart.
Applied mean imputation for numerical columns.
Applied mode imputation for categorical columns.
Removed columns with more than 70% missing values.
Validated the dataset using missing value checks, data types, and info().
Compared dataset size and quality before and after cleaning.

Before vs After Comparison:
Number of columns reduced due to removal of high-missing features.
Missing values significantly reduced.
Overall data quality improved.

Final Outcome:

The cleaned dataset contains minimal missing values and is suitable for further analysis and machine learning tasks.
