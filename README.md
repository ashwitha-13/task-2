Exploratory Data preprocessing on House Price dataset  and Medical Appointment dataset
AI & ML Internship – Task 2
Data Cleaning & Missing Value Handling
Overview
This task focuses on cleaning real-world datasets by identifying and handling missing values to improve data quality and prepare the data for analysis and machine learning.

The task was performed on two datasets:
House Price Dataset
Medical Appointment No Shows Dataset

Datasets Used
Day3_House_Price_data (1).csv
medical appointment dataset.csv

Tools Used
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib

Steps Performed
Loaded datasets and identified missing values using isnull().sum().
Visualized missing data patterns using bar charts.
Applied mean imputation for numerical columns.
Applied mode imputation for categorical columns.
Removed columns with more than 70% missing values.
Validated datasets using missing value checks, data types, and info().
Compared dataset size and quality before and after cleaning.

Before vs After Comparison
Number of columns reduced due to removal of high-missing features
Missing values significantly reduced
Overall data quality and consistency improved

Final Outcome
Both datasets were successfully cleaned, validated, and prepared for further analysis and machine learning tasks with minimal missing values.
